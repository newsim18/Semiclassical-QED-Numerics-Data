# Semiclassical QED Data

The two top level folders correspond to two separate classical background electric field profiles. The first is the asymptotically constant background profile (AC) and the other is the Sauter pulse background profile (SP).

Each subfolder is named according to the characteristic quantity qE/m^2, which is labeled by a value for E, q, and m^2.

Each .txt file corresponds to the following:

`A1_*` - gauge field

`deltaA1_*` - perturbed gauge field

`E1_*` - electric field

`E2_*` - electric field with initial condition given by "E0 + 10^-3"

`deltaE1_*` - perturbed electric field

`Jq1_*` - quantum current

`deltaJq1_*` - perturbed quantum current

Each .txt file is just one column of data for the relevant quantity corresponding to a range of times.
